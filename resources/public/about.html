  <h1>About Epic Draft Club</h1>
  <h2>What is Epic Draft Club?</h2>
  <p>Epic Draft Club is a web site for doing cube drafts of
     <a href='http://epiccardgame.com'>Epic Card Game</a>. Use it to coordinate
     online drafts with your friends.
  </p>
  <h3><a href='/new.html'>Click Here to Start a New Draft</a></h3>
  <p>Epic Draft Club is a no-frills drafting experience. It does one thing and
     one thing only: run Epic drafts. We pay our programmers nothing and pass
     those savings on to <strong>YOU</strong>. Here are the things that Epic
     Draft Club does <strong>NOT</strong> have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chat</li>
    <li>Draft queues</li>
    <li>Downloadable decks</li>
    <li>Usernames and passwords</li>
    <li>A virtual tabletop</li>
    <li>A timer, goofgrabbing, click-and-drag, etc...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instead, our users are encouraged to coordinate amongst themselves using
     existing tools like Discord and Cockatrice.
  </p>
  <p>On the other hand, if you're a programmer who likes to do work for free,
     the source code for Epic Draft Club is on GitHub:
     <a href='http://github.com/wmorganjr/epic'>http://github.com/wmorganjr/epic</a>.
     It's written in Clojure and bad HTML and we welcome contributions.

  <h2>How to Run a Draft</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Get a group of people together to play online.</li>
  <li>Go here: <a href='/new.html'>/new.html</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the sets you want to draft with, and the number of cards in each
      pack. Reasonable defaults are provided for you.</li>
  <li>Enter the players' names in the text area provided.</li>
  <li>Click "Start Draft".</li>
  <li>What you get back is a list of links, one for each player. Send each
      player their link, which they'll follow to get to their seat. <strong>SAVE THESE
      LINKS</strong>. There is no way to get them back. If someone's Internet connection
      cuts out in the middle of the draft, someone else can open their link to
      make their picks for them.</li>
  <li>Take your seat and draft away!</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How to Participate in a Draft</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Follow the link from the player who's running the draft, from Step 6, above.</li>
  <li>You'll be presented with your first pack. Select the card you want to take, and
      click the "Pick" button to the <strong> RIGHT</strong> of the card. Epic Draft
      Club takes no responsibility for mispicks because you clicked the wrong button.</li>
  <li>Wait for your next pack. The "Pick Summary" table at the top of the page will
      tell you how many cards each player has picked.</li>
  <li>If you want to look at the cards you've drafted already, click the "Drafted
      Cards" link. Click the "Pack" link to get back to your current pack.</li>
  <li>Your second and third packs will come to you immediately after you've drafted
      the final card in the previous pack. If you want to review your picks in
      between packs (e.g. to simulate the drafting at Worlds), wait until your pack
      contains one card, then review your picks, then take the last card and continue.</li>
  <li>Nothing special will happen after you take your last card. Click "Drafted Cards"
      to see the list of cards you drafted. If you want to build your deck and play with
      it, then you have to copy it manually into a program like Cockatrice.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please report them on GitHub, here:
  <a href='http://github.com/wmorganjr/epic/issues/new'>http://github.com/wmorganjr/epic/issues/new</a>.
  I can't promise any of them will get done, but it can't hurt to ask.
